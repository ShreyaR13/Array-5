"""
Write a program to calculate tax if Salary and Tax Brackets are given as list in the form
[ [10000, .3],[20000, .2], [30000, .1], [None, .1]]. You donâ€™t know in the beginning how many tax brackets are there.
You have to test for all of them.

TC - O(n) -- since moving through all tax slabs
However, since number of tax slabs will always be finite, we can also say TC is O(1)
SC - O(1)
